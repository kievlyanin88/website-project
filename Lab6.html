        <p1>On this HTML webpage you can read not a lot about me, however this should be enough.</p1>
        <ul>
            <li>1. When people get to know each other first of all they ask their name, mine is Denys.</li>
            <li>2. Second question people usually ask is about age, I am 18.</li>
            <li>3. Despite its banality, third question is fundamental in building relationship. You're right, this question is about interest and hobbies. Here I'm stopping for while.</li> 
        </ul>
        <p1>This question requires a bit more than one sentence. You'll never guess these, so I won't pull the cat by the tail and tell you straight away: armorvehicles and finish cuisine. Here I'm gonna tell you about cuisin because it's much more easier than about armorvehicles.<br></p1>
        <p2><br>Finland is cold country in northern Europe, where climate is very brutal. As is well knowm human can live almost everywhere, so it is not really suprising that even there people can cook delicious food.</p2>
